# Project-B10-KAGGLE---Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behavior-Dataset

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes mobile device usage patterns and classifies user behavior using machine learning techniques. By leveraging key metrics like app usage time, screen-on time, battery consumption, and data usage, the project provides actionable insights for app optimization, user engagement strategies, and targeted marketing.

## **Motivation**
Understanding mobile usage behavior is crucial for:
- Optimizing app performance.
- Enhancing user engagement.
- Improving targeted marketing strategies.

This analysis uses a comprehensive dataset of 700 mobile users, categorized into behavioral classes, to uncover key patterns and develop predictive models.

## **Project Goals**
- Analyze User Behavior Patterns: Investigate trends in app usage, screen time, and data consumption.
- Build a Predictive Model: Classify user behavior into predefined classes with at least 85% accuracy.
- Identify Key Factors: Highlight metrics that influence high mobile usage.
## **Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub
