# Project-B10-KAGGLE---Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behavior-Dataset

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes mobile device usage patterns and classifies user behavior using machine learning techniques. By leveraging key metrics like app usage time, screen-on time, battery consumption, and data usage, the project provides actionable insights for app optimization, user engagement strategies, and targeted marketing.

## **Motivation**
Understanding mobile usage behavior is crucial for:
- Optimizing app performance.
- Enhancing user engagement.
- Improving targeted marketing strategies.

This analysis uses a comprehensive dataset of 700 mobile users, categorized into behavioral classes, to uncover key patterns and develop predictive models.
